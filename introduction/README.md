The react-hooks enables us to use 'states' and 'lifecycles methods' without using ___Class___ syntax, reducing the code verbosity.

[Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

__Note__

React 16.8.0 is the first release to support Hooks. When upgrading, donâ€™t forget to update all packages, including React DOM. React Native supports Hooks since the 0.59 release of React Native.

This new react-hooks Api can reduce verbosity from libraries like Redux, Apollo(graphQL), and others that want to serve data to our app.

----
`__Basic Hooks__`

## Hook { useState }

This hook will belong to the component function, allowing working with states using functions syntax.

const [techs, setTechs] = useState([])

const [1 , 2] = 3(4)

1 - techs - state brand
2 - setTechs - It's a function used to update this unique state, like the ___this.setState___ but for a unique state.
3 - useState - this hook return an array.
4 - initial state argument is only used during the first render ( null, '',[], [{text:}], number, etc...  )

## Hook { useEffect}

This hook replaces the lifecycle methods used in ___Class___ syntax.

useEffect(()=>{1},[2])
1 - function to be executed
2 - when the fuction should be perfomed - empty for only one time.

Every time you are using some variable inside the useEffect it must be declared into the array to be monitored.

## Hook {useMemo}

This hook came to help us avoid expensive calculations on every render.

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => /1/ - computeExpensiveValue(a, b), /2/ [a, b]);

1 - function statement
2 - states used by a function to be monitored, trigger the useMemo on every change.

## Hook { useCallBack }

It's like the useMemo but instead returns a single value it will return a function, to prevent unnecessary renders.

useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps)

`__Redux Hooks__`

With this new approuch we can simplify the redux implementation and reduce the code verbosity.
avoid to use connect(), mapStateToProps(), MapDispatchToProps()

## Hooks from react-redux { useSelector }
Replacing mapStateToProps

const result : any = useSelector(selector : Function, equalityFn? : Function)

## Hooks from react-redux { useDispatch}
replace mapDispatchToProps
